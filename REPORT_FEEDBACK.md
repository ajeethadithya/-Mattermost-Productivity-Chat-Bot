| ITEM | SCORE | FEEDBACK |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PRESENTATION** | 17.5/25 | Problem description is not supported in slides.   Video quality makes text hard to read.  Adding the “Create Issue” functionality seems like the bot does too many things — todo or issue creation?  Why make users type in those long issues IDs?   Aren’t there only 3 (1,2,3)?    Creating meeting too?   Although this bot is supposed to be about focus, it appears to split the focus of the bot on many different things.  |
| **PEER PRESENTATION EVALUATIONS** | 10.0/10 | (If you did 4 or more, your bonus will be on your individual moodle grade.) |
| **REPORT** | 15.0/15 |  |
| **360 PEER EVALUATION** | 50.0/50 | (If your moodle score is significantly lower than your team score, you might not have submitted a 360 peer evaluation.) |
