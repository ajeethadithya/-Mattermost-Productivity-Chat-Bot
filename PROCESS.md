**Practices**

The Scrumban methodology was used to follow a continuous flow approach that helped us to plan, work, review and measure the outcomes regularly. The Kanban Board on the inbuilt Github Projects provided a glance of the progress of each team members. The workflow was easier to visualize using this methodology.

1. Scrum
