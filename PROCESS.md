**Practices**

The Scrumban methodology was used to follow a continuous flow approach that helped us to plan, work, review and measure the outcomes regularly. The Kanban Board on the inbuilt Github Projects provided a glance of the progress of each team members. The workflow was easier to visualize using this methodology. 

In general, a number of software practices can be integrated during the software development. The different types of software practices include: 

1. Scrum
2. Feature Driven Development
3. Crystal Methods
4. Extreme Programming - Core Practice
5. Corollary Practices

To build the Focus Bot, our team used a hybrid practice of the Extreme Programming and a Corollary Practice. We initially identified a core practice among the different XP's Concepts that includes fine-scale feedback, continuous process, shared understanding and programming welfare. We believed that integrating the stages of development by each member would result in easier tracking of the overall progress and hence we chose the Continuous Integration Practice. 

Each of our use cases were split into multiple commands. For instance, the Github issues use-case was divided into show issues, add issue and close issues. Each of these commands were implemented parallelly and integrated. We kept track of the progress for the commands using the kanban board and github issues. Since we kept commiting the code then and there, we were able to identify compatibility errors early in the process. Also since the scrumban methodology was used, there wasn't any communication gap between the team members and all of us got to work with the latest version. Furthermore, error handling for each of these commands were also performed continuously and unit tests were run when small portions of the planned functionalities were finished to detect errors quickly.

Following the primary practice, few corollary practices like team continuity and shared code were integrated along. Each team member were valued equally and a reasonable amount of rotation was encouraged to spread knowledge and experience among us. Better team coordination was developed by following this practice. Also, each team member had the freedom to improve any part of the system anytime by following a shared code base. By developing a sense of collective responsibility, we were able to work together and deliver a high quality software.
