## Problem Statement:

 “Working at home features distractions and more than one in 10 millennials admitted being distracted by playing video games during the workday and one in five boomers did laundry during the workday.”

We are aware that a company’s profitability is proportional to the overall productivity of different departments which in turn depends on the employee’s throughput. How to get the most and aid the employees to achieve their potential in every project? Automation with BOTs. In light of the current pandemic causing seismic disruptions to work culture and forcing employees around the globe to transition to a remote work environment, employees could do with a little help to create a pseudo work environment without having to carry out mundane and non-essential tasks. Working from home, despite sounding great for the first few weeks comes with numerous challenges- from virtual collaborations, employees losing track of time and goals to be achieved, and a variety of other distractions. The lack of in-person interaction and collaboration makes it difficult for higher authority to create a high-performing environment and hence lies on the individual to create a strong communication process and the team to build a self-organizing culture especially in the development and deployment phases of the software development life cycle

## Bot Description:

To facilitate this transition - a bot acting as a mini personal assistant with a primary objective to enhance productivity and provide the option to collaborate in crucial instances and subsequently, lead to the timely development and smooth software life cycle progress from an individual and team’s perspective.

- Our Focus Bot retrieves the GitHub issues assigned to the particular user in a shared repo and converts it into a To-Do List. 
- The bot provides a function to add user specific tasks to their To-Do list besides pulling the GitHub issues for each user. The user has the ability to view current tasks, mark tasks as completed, add and delete new tasks. 
- The bot enables the user to also close GitHub issues assigned to them on the shared repo. 
- The bot also has the ability to create reminders at regular intervals for the GitHub issues that are part of a user’s To-Do list. Users can also create custom reminders for user specific tasks. 
- The Focus Bot dynamically identifies overdue GitHub issues (eg.: unresolved issue for 3 days) on a user’s To-Do list, and reminds the user. 
- If a user is behind on his tasks to be completed, the bot generates a list of team members based on their availability to enable collaboration for overdue task completion. 
- Based on the selected team member, a request and then a meeting is also scheduled by the bot.
