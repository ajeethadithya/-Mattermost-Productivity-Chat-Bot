 #### <b> Use Case 5: Create Issues. </b>

<b> Preconditions: </b>
- User has access to the PAM Bot and Mattermost account.

-User enters the repository name. [S3]
-User is prompted to enter the issue. [S4]

<b> Sub flows: </b>
- [S1] User enters a command to create an issue (Command: create issue).
- [S2] Bot displays user's repo list.

 -[S4] User enters issue body with "++" precedig the body. Bot acknowledges the issue creation.

<b> Alternative Flows: </b>
- [E1] _Invalid repo name_.
 -[E2] - Incorrect syntax

 
 

#### Use Case 6: Displaying Google Calender Meetings

<b> Preconditions: </b>
 -All users have a Google service account.
- All users have provided access to Google calendars.

 -All users have provided their credential ID and OAUTH tokens.

<b> Main Flow: </b>
- User enters command to display his google calender details. [S1] 
- Bot inputs user's Google Credential ID.[S2]
- Displays all available meetings for the user int he given day [S3]

<b> Sub flows: </b>
- [S1] User enters a command to check meeting schedule(s) (Command: "show meetings").
- [S2] Bot inputs user's credential ID (in this case email address, eg. UNITYID@ncsu.edu).
- [S3] Bot displays all the available meeting schedules. 

<b> Alternative Flows: </b>

 #### Changes from previous submission:
 
 - Use Case refinement - The feedback provided was taken into consideration and the following were modified. 
 
 -The command format is mentioned in detail to better facilitate understanding of syntax (eg.show meeting, -<task name>
 -Sequential flow is discussed in more detail to understand the workflow. 
 -Use Cases have been seperated into modular units to better represent their functionality.
