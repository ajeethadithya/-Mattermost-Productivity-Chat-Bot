| <tr><th colspan=3> Setup </th></tr> |
| **Problem Stmt** | 15.0/15 | Good job |
| **Bot Description** | 10.0/10 | Good job |
| **Use Cases** | 10.0/15 | NOTE THIS IS FEEDBACK YOU PREVIOUSLY RECEIVED<br /><br />You have a start on your Use Cases, but they need Revisions:    All UCs -- Each subflow and error flow should be numbered like [S1] or [E1] and needs to be referenced from the main flow.   Give the format of the commands.  The UCs need to be detailed enough to know when they're done.  "Bot returns information regarding tasks" <-- not specific enough.  What information?   That belongs in the UC.   <br><br>UC3 "User requests availability of other users."  Again, needs more detail -- how do they ask for this?  What information is provided?  Usernames?  Full Names? |
| **Wireframes** | 15.0/15 | Good job |
| **Storyboard** | 15.0/15 | Good job |
| **Architecture + Additional Patterns** | 30.0/30 |  |
