### Problem the Bot Solved

*HOCUS POCUS, DON’T LOSE YOUR FOCUS*

“Working at home features distractions and more than one in 10 millennials admitted being distracted by playing video games during the workday and one in five boomers did laundry during the workday.”

We are aware that a company’s profitability is proportional to the overall productivity of different departments which in turn depends on the employee’s throughput. How to get the most and aid the employees to achieve their potential in every project? Automation with BOTs. In light of the current pandemic causing seismic disruptions to work culture and forcing employees around the globe to transition to a remote work environment, employees could do with a little help to create a pseudo work environment without having to carry out mundane and non-essential tasks. Working from home, despite sounding great for the first few weeks comes with numerous challenges- from virtual collaborations, employees losing track of time and goals to be achieved, and a variety of other distractions. The lack of in-person interaction and collaboration makes it difficult for higher authority to create a high-performing environment and hence lies on the individual to create a strong communication process and the team to build a self-organizing culture especially in the development and deployment phases of the software development life cycle.

To facilitate this transition and improve productivity, our bot acts as a mini personal assistant with a primary objective to enhance productivity and provide the option to collaborate in crucial instances and subsequently, lead to the timely development and smooth software life cycle progress from an individual and team’s perspective.

### Primary Features and Screenshots

Our Focus Bot has five primary use cases:

1. Personal To-Do List
