## Deployment Scripts

## Acceptance Testing
### Instructions

Use the following link to access the Focus Bot on the Mattermost Channel (Team-24) 

    https://chat.robotcodelab.com/csc510-s22/channels/team-24

Once you go to the channel, the bot will display the following message:

"Hi there! I am PAM - your Personal Accountability Manager

Hocus Pocus - Let's focus!"

You can start the conversation by typing "hi" and you should expect the following message from the Focus Bot.

"Good to see you here! Hocus Pocus - Let's help you Focus."

Type "help" to learn the list of tasks that the bot can perform and the commands that you can use for the same.

Note: The commands you type are case-sensitive. For example, if you type Help instead of help, the bot will reply saying: "I can only understand a few commands! After all I am a bot! Please type help for a list of valid commands."
